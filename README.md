For paper "Modeling of Buildings from aerial LiDAR point clouds using TINs and label maps"
Here we provide test data and binary executable files.
The source code will be coming soon after I delete some useless functions. 
Please look at the DemoModeling.wmv, then you will know how to use the binary file.
